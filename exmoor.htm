<h1>Dartmoor</h1>
<p>Dartmoor is an amazing place, with a different world-class view around every footpath corner; Whether your idea of fun is an ultra marathon on the highest cliffs in England or a cream tea by the side of a babbling brook, then Exmoor is the pace to be. We are recognized as one of the best locations for walking in Europe and have road cycling good enough to host the Tour of Britain.</p>
<p>Feel the open space of our heather topped moorland, catch a glimpse of wild red deer or iconic Exmoor ponies, explore our mysterious and very special woodlands, find your new favourite village pub, or marvel at a unique landscape shaped by people and nature over thousands of years.</p>
